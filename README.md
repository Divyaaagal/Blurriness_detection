There are two python files in this repo, both of them do the same task i.e. Detects if the image is blur or not and returns.

    1. In blur_detection.py, you have to put path of your image in line 4 and it will return the Boolean result with threshold.
    2. streamlitapp.py will launch a app on brower where you can see the image with the desired results.
